# Regression-on-Used-Bike-Prices---A-Machine-Learning-Approach
The objective of this project is to analyze, clean, and transform raw used bike sales data into a structured, insightful, and modeling-ready dataset in order to understand the factors that significantly influence the resale value of two-wheelers..Here factors which have the strongest impact on bike resale price is determined.It identifies high-value brands/models that retain resale value.finally it provides evidence-based recommendations to sellers and buyers for fair pricing.


The resale market for two-wheelers is growing rapidly, with customers looking for affordable, reliable, and fuel-efficient bikes. However, pricing a used bike fairly is challenging because it depends on multiple factors like age, kilometers driven, engine capacity, brand reputation, and ownership history.
